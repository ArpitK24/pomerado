 * Replays the recipe on the run's own browser with the host's fill: each screen is found and
 * judged (one visible match, frame and form on the site or a configured sign-in origin), filled
 * and submitted, then the host checks the indicator. The build's rules hold: a password or code
 * goes out at most twice, a visible credential rejection stops before another fill, and an empty
 * combined screen without distinct code-rejection evidence ends the replay
 * (`ambiguous_combined_rejection`).
 * A value counts as sent once a submit was clicked after it was filled.
